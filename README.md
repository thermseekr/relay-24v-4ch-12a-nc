# RELAY-24V-4CH-12A-NC

Relay board with 4x 24 VDC NC relays. This board is designed to be used togheter with [ESP-24V-16CH](https://github.com/thermseekr/esp-24v-16ch) and [ESP-24V-32CH](https://github.com/thermseekr/esp-24v-32ch), but can be driven by any 24V control circuit compatible with NPN inputs.

The dimensions are such that the boards can be mounted on a PCB DIN rail holder from the Brazilian manufacturer Metaltex, check [here](https://www.metaltex.com.br/produtos/componentes/suportes/sp7-suporte-para-montagem-de-placa-de-circuito-impresso-em-trilho-din) for details.
